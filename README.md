## The Photographic Works of Aleister Crowlaid ##

Galleries and videos to present my visual (photographic works).

## Technical facts ##

- The images are retrieved from my flickr sets with the Flickr API (see js/jquery.flickr.vampirama.x.x.x.js for the details). The inspiration and initial code for that little script is the [Supersized Flickr plugin](https://github.com/buildinternet/supersized/tree/master/flickr)
- The diaporam itself is displayed with a customized version of [jquery.backstretch](https://github.com/zipang/jquery-backstretch)
- The videos are displayed with Vimeo Couch Mode in an iframe (which does in fact pose problems in Safari).
